# Add3 Front-end Take Home

This is a front-end project for the role of front-end engineer at Add3. In this Readme I will try my best to explain how to use this web app, so keep reading.

## Step 1: Connecting/Disconnecting MetaMask Wallet

The green button on top right corner that reads 'Connect to MetaMask' connects the web app to your MetaMask account. You will be asked to choose an account of your liking from a dropdown after clicking this button. Once connected, it will turn blue and display your account address.

In order to disconnect MetaMask, click the same button again OR refresh the page.

## Step 2: Transferring Goerli tokens in MetaMask account in order to execute smart contract functions

First, create an Alchemy account if you don't already have one. Then, go to https://goerlifaucet.com/ and enter your MetaMask account address in order to receive free goerli tokens.

## Step 3: Enter RPC URL in MetaMask

Create a new Network on MetaMask and add the RPC URL from your Alchemy profile. This will connect your account to the Goerli Network.

## Step 3: Finally, you are ready to Mint Tokens!

In the Dashboard, you will find an input field. Try entering your account address after copying it from MetaMask and notice that the Account Balance displayed on the left changes.
